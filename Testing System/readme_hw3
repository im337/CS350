Hi professor/TA in charge of grading! here are some things u should know before grading.

First of all, for the test grading part, I programmed so that both essay and short answer questions to be graded manually, and those questions will be ignored during the final grading process.
I feel that auto grading short answer questions is kinda lame, for the students taking the test.

My preferred method of running the program is to run the main method in MainTest.java, within the /src/tests/ directory
Tests and surveys are save to the /tests/ and /surveys/ directories, responses are in the /responses/ directory.
Responses are named by their corresponding test/survey + _rx, where x is the response number. There are 3 responses for the test and the survey, allowing for easier tabulation/grading.

also, there is no support for multiple answers for a multiple choice question.
also sometimes quitting doesn't fully work. (rare bug)
