Hi professor/TA in charge of grading! here are some things u should know before grading.

First of all, there is no support for multiple questions... yet.
To start the program for grading purposes, run the main method in MainTest.java, within the /src/tests/ directory
tests and surveys are save to the /tests/ and /surveys/ directories. There is a sample test and survey in each directory for your viewing pleasure.

I have setup the saving of the survey/test as a step in survey/test creation menu. I'm kind of confused how choice 4 of the menu, (saving a test), would work normally. How would it know what test to save?
Also, choices 2 and 3 of displaying a survey/test and loading a survey/test do the same thing. I'm also confused as to how I would display a survey/test without loading it, or selecting it first.

The last thing is sometimes the program quit option (option 5) doesn't fully work, and can lead to weird glitchy situations. I think it only doesn't work for tests.
